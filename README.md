# Certified Undecidability of Intuitionistic Linear Logic via Binary Stack Machines and Minsky Machines

Yannick Forster <forster@ps.uni-saarland.de>, Dominique Larchey-Wendling <dominique.larchey-wendling@loria.fr>

This repository contains the Coq formalisation of the paper "Certified Undecidability of Intuitionistic Linear Logic via Binary Stack Machines and Minsky Machines" ([pre-print](https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~forster/downloads/certified-undecidability-of-ill.pdf)), currently under review.

## How to compile the code

`make coq` should do the job. The files are tested to compile with `The Coq Proof Assistant, version 8.8.2 (October 2018)`.

The compiled HTML version of the files can be found [here](https://uds-psl.github.io/ill-undecidability/toc.html) or in the `docs` subdirectory of this repository.
